# Week2

I made several improvements to enhance the clarity, functionality, and visualization of your Power BI report. First, I provided a detailed step-by-step guide for implementing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) Calculation using a DAX formula, explaining how it works and how to apply conditional formatting in a table for better data interpretation. I also suggested aligning and grouping KPI cards to ensure a well-structured dashboard layout. Additionally, I recommended using color-coded values in conditional formatting to easily distinguish production trends. To further enhance insights, I explained how to use slicers and filters effectively and suggested adding a KPI visualization to highlight key performance metrics. Lastly, I emphasized improving the overall dashboard formatting by structuring visualizations properly, adding a title, and ensuring the key insights like Top 5 Crops and Production Trends are prominently displayed for a more professional and user-friendly report.
